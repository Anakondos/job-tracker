    "why_this_role": {
      "question": "Why are you interested in this role?",
      "answer": "With 15+ years leading complex technology programs for Fortune 500 companies, I'm passionate about driving cross-functional teams to deliver high-impact results. This role aligns perfectly with my experience in program management, stakeholder communication, and delivering measurable business outcomes. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise in cloud migrations, platform modernization, and agile delivery to contribute to your team's success."
    },
    "why_this_company": {
      "question": "Why do you want to work at [Company]?",
      "answer": "I'm drawn to [Company]'s commitment to innovation and technology excellence. Your focus on [specific area] resonates with my background in delivering enterprise-scale solutions. I'm particularly impressed by [recent news/product/initiative] and see a strong alignment between my experience driving digital transformation programs and your company's strategic direction.",
      "placeholders": ["[Company]", "[specific area]", "[recent news/product/initiative]"]
    },
    "biggest_achievement": {
      "question": "What is your biggest professional achievement?",
      "answer": "Leading Deutsche Bank's first GCP cloud migration stands out as my most significant achievement. I directed a team of 50+ engineers to migrate 15 applications and 50+ microservices to Google Cloud Platform, achieving $1.2M in annual cost savings, 25% uptime improvement, and 50% faster release cycles. This required careful coordination across global teams, managing complex dependencies, and maintaining zero production incidents throughout the transition."
    },
    "leadership_example": {
      "question": "Describe a time you led a team through a challenge.",
      "answer": "During the Deutsche Bank-Fidessa merger integration, I led a 100+ person cross-functional team to unify trading platforms across 8 asset classes and 15 countries. The challenge was immense: different technologies, processes, and cultures. I established clear governance frameworks, created detailed dependency maps, and facilitated daily coordination across time zones. We achieved 98% SIT success rate with zero downtime during cutover, completing the integration on schedule."
    },
    "conflict_resolution": {
      "question": "How do you handle conflicts in a team?",
      "answer": "I address conflicts directly but constructively. In one instance, engineering and product teams disagreed on migration priorities. I facilitated a structured discussion where each side presented their constraints and priorities. By mapping dependencies and business impact together, we reached a consensus that satisfied both technical requirements and business timelines. The key is creating space for open dialogue while keeping focus on shared objectives."
    },
    "failure_example": {
      "question": "Tell me about a time you failed.",
      "answer": "Early in a platform modernization project, I underestimated the complexity of legacy system dependencies. This led to a delayed milestone. I took ownership, communicated transparently with stakeholders, and implemented more rigorous dependency mapping for future phases. The lesson: never assume you fully understand legacy systems without deep technical discovery. This experience shaped my approach to always build buffer time for unknowns."
    },
    "technical_depth": {
      "question": "How technical are you?",
      "answer": "While I'm not writing production code daily, I have strong technical fluency. I've architected data platforms processing 200TB+, implemented CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and worked hands-on with AWS, GCP, Terraform, and Docker. I can read code, participate in architecture discussions, and bridge the gap between engineering teams and business stakeholders effectively."
    },
    "agile_experience": {
      "question": "Describe your experience with Agile/Scrum.",
      "answer": "I'm SAFe POPM certified with extensive hands-on experience. At DXC, I facilitate PI Planning for 5 Agile teams (60+ engineers), manage sprint ceremonies, and drive continuous improvement through retrospectives. I've worked across Scrum, Kanban, and hybrid methodologies, always adapting the framework to team needs rather than forcing rigid processes."
    },
    "salary_expectations": {
      "question": "What are your salary expectations?",
      "answer": "Based on my 15+ years of experience and the scope of this role, I'm targeting the range of $150,000-$180,000 base, depending on the total compensation package including equity, bonus, and benefits. I'm flexible and open to discussing what works for both sides.",
      "note": "Adjust based on role level and company"
    },
    "availability": {
      "question": "When can you start?",
      "answer": "I can start within 2-3 weeks of accepting an offer, allowing time for a smooth transition from my current responsibilities."
    },
    "remote_work": {
      "question": "Are you open to remote/hybrid/on-site work?",
      "answer": "I'm flexible and effective in all work arrangements. I've successfully led globally distributed teams across US, UK, and India time zones. For this role, I'm open to remote, hybrid, or on-site based on team needs and can travel as required for key meetings and PI Planning events."
    },
    "management_style": {
      "question": "Describe your management style.",
      "answer": "I lead with clarity, accountability, and empowerment. I set clear expectations and goals, then give teams autonomy to execute while providing support and removing blockers. I believe in regular 1:1s, transparent communication, and celebrating wins. My teams know I'll advocate for them while holding everyone, including myself, accountable to commitments."
